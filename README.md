Data repository and source code for GEMINI ICI-mono vs ICI-Chemo analysis as described in Hong et al, "Efficacy and clinicogenomic correlates of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or with chemotherapy in NSCLC". These data will be made public at time of acceptance.  

Data used for running the predictive models:
* MDACC primary cohort immune-monotherapy group for training (MDACCtrain_ICI_Mono)
* MDACC primary cohort immune-chemotherapy group for training (MDACCtrain_ICI_Chemo)
* MDACC validation cohort immune-monotherapy group for validation (MDACCVal_ICI_Mono)
* MDACC validation cohort immune-chemotherapy group for validation (MDACCVal_ICI_Chemo)
* Mayo validation cohort immune-monotherapy group for validation (MayoVal_ICI_Mono)
* Mayo validation cohort immune-chemotherapy group for validation (MayoVal_ICI_Chemo)
